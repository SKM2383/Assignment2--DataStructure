I decided to use the ArrayOrderedList data structure to hold the User information within the database because:
  1) It orders all the Users in the database using their gender, date of birth, and username respectively
  2) It implements the binary search algorithm for searching within itself, which allows for faster lookups
  3) Due to being implemented with an array, traversing through the list is an easy task to accomplish
  4) This data structure is unbounded and dynamically increases its size when needed, this attribute is needed for a database that will be continually growing
